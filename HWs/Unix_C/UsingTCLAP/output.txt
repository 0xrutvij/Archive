                                                       IV.
                                           SHARING SECRETS

WELCOME THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THE WORK OF BUILDING VERBS, ADJECTIVES
AND NOUNS FOR MORTALITY AND ITS SUBSEQUENT ETERNAL BREAKING OF CONCRETE.

                I.      REVELATION
                    REVEL AT ION,
                    REBEL AT I ONE A COURSE
                    TO REGRET ERECTIONS,
                    TO WHIP THE CREAM IN MY SCROTUM
                    TILL IT HARDENS INTO UNSWEETENED,
                    UNSAFE REVVED ELATIONS
                    OF MILK TURNED SOUR
                    BY THE HUMAN BODY,
                    OF PROPAGATION OF DESTRUCTION.
                    THE EPIPHANY: I AM UNSAFE,
                    YOU WHO WANT ME
                    KNOW THAT I WHO WANT YOU,
                    HARBOR THE BITTER BALM OF DEFEAT.
 
                    II.    SALVATION
                    IF I WERE TO SHOW YOU
                    HOW TO CONTINUE HOLDING ON,
                    I WOULD NOT KISS YOU,
                    I WOULD NOT MIX MY FLUIDS WITH YOURS,
                    FOR YOUR SALVATION
                    CANNOT BEAR THE LIVE WEIGHT
                    OF YOUR SHARING LIQUIDS WITH ME.
 
                    III.   LANGUAGE
                    TO TELL,
                    TO TALK,
                    TO TONGUE INTO SOUNDS
                    HOW I WOULD CLEANSE YOU WITH URINE,
                    HOW MY TASTING TONGUE WOULD WASH YOUR BODY,
                    HOW MY SALIVA AND SPERM WOULD BLOAT YOU,
                    TO TOUCH YOU IN OUR LOVEMAKING
                    AND NOT TELL YOU
                    WOULD AMOUNT TO MURDER,
                    TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LANGUAGE THIS
                    SO THAT YOU WOULD STILL LANGUISH
                    IN MY UNSAFE ARMS AND DIE,
                    SEEMS BEYOND ME,
                    I WOULD ALMOST RATHER LIE
                    BUT MY TONGUE MUSCLE MOVES INVOLUNTARILY
                    TO TELL OF THE DANGER IN ME.
 
                    IV.    OF HEALTH
                    TO USE MY FULL AND WILLING
                    BODY TO REVEAL AND SPEAK
                    THE STRENGTH THAT I IMPART
                    WITHOUT FEAR,
                    WITHOUT KILLING,
                    WITHOUT TAKING AWAY WHAT I WOULD GIVE,
                    TO USE MY MAN'S TONGUE
                    TO SHARE,
                    TO GIVE,
                    TO LEND,
                    TO EXACT NOTHING,
                    TO RECEIVE ALL THINGS,
                    TO EXPAND MY MACHO
                    AND LET THE WHOLE WORLD
                    INTO THE SAFETY OF MY MATURE MASCULINITY.
 
                    V.    QUARANTINE
                    SOMETIMES I FEAR TOUCHING YOUR PLUMP EAR LOBES:
                    I MIGHT CONTAMINATE YOU.
                    SOMETIMES I REFUSE ODORS THAT WOULD
                    DRIVE MY HANDS TO OPEN YOUR THICK THIGHS.
                    SOMETIMES CLOSING MY EARS TO YOUR VOICE
                    WRENCHES MY STOMACH AND I VOMIT TO CALM WANTING.
                    CAN IT BE THAT I AM THE BEARER OF PLAGUES?
                    AM I POISON TO DESIRE?
                    DO I HAVE TO DENY YEARNING FOR FIRM FULL FLESH
                    SO THAT I’LL NOT KILL WHAT I LOVE?
                    NO JUICES CAN FLOW 'TWEEN YOU AND ME.
                    QUICKSAND WILL SUCK ME IN.
